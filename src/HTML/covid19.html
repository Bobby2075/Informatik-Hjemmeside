        <p>Accurate view of Covid-19</p>
        <p>By A Person</p>


        <h2>The Wealthy Elite is spreading the virus to win power and profit</h2>
        <p>
            In a video from a conspiracy theory film entitled Plandemic and a book she co-authored, a woman named Judy Mikovits, who once published a high-profile, is now being targeted by the left to take back her claims about covid-19 and the link to the wealthy elite. Mikovits claims that covid-19 is linked to Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and that they have used their power to gain profit from the virus.

        <h2>The Politicians want you to believe Covid-19 is worse then the common flu.</h2>
        <p>
            Starting in the early days of the pandemic, Trump repeatedly claimed that the disease is not more dangerous than seasonal influenza.<br> on September 9 the Washington Post published recordings of Trump​ telling journalist and author Bob Woodward—in interviews in early February and late March—that the president knew COVID-19 was more deadly than the flu and that he wanted to play down its severity. <br> Although COVID-19’s exact mortality rate is hard to pin down, epidemiologists suspect it is far higher than that of the flu. <br> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the latter causes roughly 12,000 to 61,000 deaths per year in the U.S. By contrast, COVID-19 has caused more than 191,000 deaths in the country as of this writing.* <br> <br>

            Many people also have partial immunity to the flu because of vaccination or prior infection, whereas most of the world has not yet encountered COVID-19. So no, coronavirus is not “just the flu.”

        <h2>You dont need to wear a mask</h2>
        <p>
            Although early guidance on masks from the CDC and the WHO was confusing and inconsistent, there is now a strong consensus among public health authorities—supported by numerous studies—that wearing a face covering can limit the transmission of the coronavirus through small exhaled droplets. <br> <br> Masks have long been known as an effective means of source control (preventing a sick patient from spreading a disease to others), but the early guidance was based, in part, on the fact that there was a shortage of high-quality “N95” and surgical masks. <br> We now know that cloth face masks can be an effective alternative. <br> But despite the evidence, many people still refuse to wear one, considering it a violation of civil liberties or emasculating. <br> Georgia’s governor Brian Kemp went so far as to sign an executive order banning city governments from implementing mask mandates. <br> And he sued Atlanta’s mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms when she instituted one, although he has now dropped the lawsuit. <br> But as coronavirus cases have spiked around the U.S. in recent months, even states that were once staunch holdouts have now implemented mask orders.

        <h2>Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment.</h2>
        <p>
            When a small, now widely criticized study in France suggested the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine might be effective at treating the disease, Trump and others seized on it and have continued to tout the medication despite growing evidence that it does not benefit COVID-19 patients. <br> In a tweet, Trump called the hydroxychloroquine treatment “one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,” and he has mentioned it repeatedly in his public coronavirus briefings. <br> The Food and Drug Administration initially issued an emergency use authorization for the drug, but the agency later warned against its use because of the risk of heart problems and ultimately revoked its authorization. <br> Several studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine does not protect against COVID-19 in those who are exposed. <br> And in June the National Institutes of Health halted its clinical trial of the medication, stating that while it was not harmful to patients, it did not provide any benefit. <br> Yet Trump continues to hype the drug. <br> <br> Just a few weeks ago, he retweeted a video—viewed tens of millions of times before social media companies took it down—featuring Stella Immanuel, a Houston, Tex.–based physician (who has made questionable assertions in the past, including that doctors had used alien DNA in treatments and that demons cause certain medical conditions by having sex with people in their dreams) claiming hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for COVID-19.
