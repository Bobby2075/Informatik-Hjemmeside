        <h2 id="Mellemrubrik 0">4 reasons to why the moon landing is fake:</h2>

        <div class="Mellemrubrik1">

            <h2>The moon landing is a hoax:</h2>

            <div class="Brødtekst1">
                <p>Motivation for the United States to engage the Soviet Union in a Space Race can be traced to the then
                    on-going Cold War. Landing on the Moon was viewed as a national and technological accomplishment
                    that would generate world-wide acclaim. But going to the Moon would be risky and expensive, as
                    exemplified by President John F. Kennedy famously stating in a 1962 speech that the United States
                    chose to go because it was hard. That is why the moon landing needed to be faked.</p>

        <div class="Mellemrubrik2">

            <h2>Why the president needed to fake the moon landing:</h2>

            <div class="Brødtekst2">
                <p>NASA faked the landings to avoid humiliation and to ensure that it continued to get funding. NASA
                    raised "about US$30 billion" to go to the Moon. The money have been used to pay off the people to
                    keep it a secret. The landings had to be faked to fulfill Kennedy's 1961 goal, "before this decade
                    is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."</p>

            <h2>The moon landing was a distraction for the Vietnam war:</h2>

            <div class="Brødtekst3">
                <p> 
                    The American Patriot Friends Network claimed in 2009 that the landings helped the United States
                    government distract public attention from the unpopular Vietnam War, and so crewed landings suddenly
                    ended about the same time that the United States ended its involvement in the war.

            <h2>The flag:</h2>

            <div class="Brødtekst4">
                <p>
                    "In the photos, it looks as if the American flag is flapping in the breeze, but anyone can tell you
                    there shouldn’t be wind on the lunar surface. Because we had never been on the moon, the director of
                    the moon landing, arguably Stanley Kubrick, put a fan outside of the camera shot to make it appear
                    that it was blowing in the wind, which doesn’t exist on the moon, clearly showing that the moon
                    landing was fake."

                <p>
                    The goverment is trying to brainwash our feeble minds, and destroy the very foundation of our
                    society. The moon landing is fake, but what else could be? The goverment is not to be trusted, they
                    have faked every event in human history. The world wars, holocaust, nine eleven and more! The moon
                    landing was faked to promote the devil and his ideals, they are the anti christ! And they are
                    turning our people gay. They consume our very souls and devour them like beast, they do not seek
                    peace, they do not see the truth, they do not speak our language. We are being tested by a higer
                    form of life, it must be GOD! The test is the hidden calling from our sins, and we must answer
                    furiously.
