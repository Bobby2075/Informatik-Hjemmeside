            <p><b>The flat Earth model is an archaic conception of Earth's shape as a plane or disk. Many ancient cultures subscribed to a flat Earth cosmography, including Greece until the classical period (323 BC), the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations of the Near East until the Hellenistic period (31 BC), and China until the 17th century.</b></p>

            <h2>Belief in a flat Earth throughout history</h2>
            <p>Throughout history the whole world has believed in flat earth, from east to west, north to south. The only difference was the theory behind it. In early Egyptian and Mesopotamian thought, the world was a disk floating in the ocean. Israelites also believed the earth to be a disc floating on water, with the sky as a solid dome that seperated earth from the heavens. There are many more theories throughout history, such as the ancient Norse and Germanic people. They believed that earth was a flat disk surrounded by ocean with the world tree in the centre and in the surrounding oceans sat a snake called Jormungandr.

            <h2>Modern flat Earth theory</h2>
            <p>Modern flat earthes believes that Earth is a disc with the Arctic Circle in the center and Antarctica, a 150-foot-tall wall of ice, around the rim. It is also believed that gravity is an illusion. Objects do not accelerate downward; instead, the disc of Earth accelerates upward at 32 feet per second squared (9.8 meters per second squared), driven up by a mysterious force called dark energy. Earths day and night cycly is explained by positioning the sun and moon, which are sphears measuring 32 miles, 3000 miles above the plane of earth where they move in circles. Stars move in a plane 3100 miles above the plane of earth, and like spotlights the celestial sphears illuminate different portions of the planet, which leads to the planets 24-hour cycle.</p>

            <h2>How is the government keeping it hidden?</h2>
            <p>Flat earthers believe that NASA employees, are stationed to gaurd the giant ice rim surrounding the earths oceans. They do this to prevent people from climbing over and falling of the earth. It is also believed that the government and scientists fools the people by using fake images. They lie to the people to have more control over the populace. </p>
